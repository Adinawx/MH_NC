    "*Processes* -- Models the behavior of active components\n",
    "(like vehicles, customers, or messages). They are described by simple\n",

    "You can call them *process function* or *process method*, depending on\n",
    "whether it is a normal *function* or method of a class. During their\n",
    "lifetime, they create events and yield them to wait for them to occur.\n",
    "When a process `yields` an *event*, the process gets *suspended*.\n",
    "SimPy *resumes* the process when the event occurs (we say that the event\n",
    "is *processed*). Multiple processes can wait for the same event. SimPy\n",
    "resumes them in the same order in which they yielded that event.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Environment* -- where processes live.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Event* -- The way processes interact with the environment and with\n",
    "themselves. An important event type is\n",
    "the [**Timeout**](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/simpy.events.html#simpy.events.Timeout).\n",
    "Events of this type occur (are processed) after a certain amount of\n",
    "(simulated) time has passed. They allow a process to sleep (or hold its\n",
    "state) for the given time.\n",
    "A [**Timeout**](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/simpy.events.html#simpy.events.Timeout) and\n",

    "be used like an event (technically, a process actually *is* an event).\n",
    "If you yield it, you are resumed once the process has finished. Imagine\n",
    "a car-wash simulation where cars enter the car-wash and wait for the\n",

    "must wait until a security check finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s assume that the car from our last example magically became an\n",
    "electric vehicle. Electric vehicles usually take a lot of time charging\n",
    "their batteries after a trip. They must wait until their battery is\n",

    "\n",
    "We can model this with an additional `charge()` process for our car.\n",

    "# Appendix\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Python \n",
    "\n",
    "### Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken from <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generators-in-python/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A Generator in Python is a function that returns an iterator using the\n",
    "Yield keyword. In this article, we will discuss how the generator\n",
    "function works in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator function in Python is defined like a normal function, but\n",
    "whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the [yield\n",
    "keyword](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-yield-keyword/) rather\n",
    "than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function\n",
    "automatically becomes a Python generator function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Generator in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can create a generator function by simply using the def\n",
    "keyword and the yield keyword. The generator has the following syntax\n",
    "in [Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name():\n",
    "    yield statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Generator Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Generator functions return a generator object that is iterable,\n",
    "i.e., can be used as\n",
    "an [Iterator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterators-in-python/).\n",
    "Generator objects are used either by calling the next method of the\n",
    "generator object or using the generator object in a \"for in\" loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Generator Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, generator expression is another way of writing the generator\n",
    "function. It uses the Python [list\n",
    "comprehension](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-comprehension/) technique\n",
    "but instead of storing the elements in a list in memory, it creates\n",
    "generator objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator Expression Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator expression in Python has the following Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(expression for item in iterable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications of Generators in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we create a stream of Fibonacci numbers, adopting the generator\n",
    "approach makes it trivial; we just have to call `next(x) `to get the next\n",
    "Fibonacci number without bothering about where or when the stream of\n",
    "numbers ends. A more practical type of stream processing is handling\n",
    "large data files such as log files. Generators provide a space-efficient\n",
    "method for such data processing as only parts of the file are handled at\n",
    "one given point in time. We can also use Iterators for these purposes,\n",
    "but Generator provides a quick way (We don't need to write `__next__`\n",
    "and `__iter__` methods here).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to use yield instead of return in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield statement suspends a function's execution and sends a value\n",
    "back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable the function to\n",
    "resume where it left off. When the function resumes, it continues\n",
    "execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to\n",
    "produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once\n",
    "and sending them back like a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return** sends a specified value back to its caller\n",
    "whereas **Yield** can produce a sequence of values. We should use yield\n",
    "when we want to iterate over a sequence, but don't want to store the\n",
    "entire sequence in memory. Yield is used in Python **generators**. A\n",
    "generator function is defined just like a normal function, but whenever\n",
    "it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather\n",
    "than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function\n",
    "automatically becomes a generator function. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A callback is a general concept in Python as well as other languages like Javascript, C, etc. We know that Python is an object-oriented language and functions are first-class objects in Python.

    "callback. A callback function is a function that is passed to another\n",

    "1.  Passing one function as an argument to another function\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Calling a function inside another function\n",
    "\n",
    "The above two points can help you decide if a given function is a\n",
